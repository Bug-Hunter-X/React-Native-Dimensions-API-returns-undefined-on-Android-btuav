This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, particularly on Android.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might return `undefined` or incorrect values, especially during the initial app rendering or when dealing with screen rotations.
